Pixely Components is a simple library containing a bunch of JetPack Compose components that aims to replicate different Android's system app components.
</p>


## ü§î About
The main purpose of this library is to simply compansate and add useful components to the `Material3` library by Google, as some of the components already available in that library can look and/or feel outdated, or are straight up missing.
This library is a personal project meant to help my workflow, saving file and code clutter in projects, while keeping everything in a single place and making each components reusable in other projects.
All the components listed are currently used in other personal apps, such as [Revo Music Player](https://github.com/alessiocameroni/RevoMusicPlayer).

<br>

## ‚öôÔ∏èInformation
- **Simple**: each components is crafted to be as simple as possible to set up and re-use, with a clean and straight-forward source code for beginners.
- **Material You**: each component is based off of AOSP Android 13 system apps and Google apps, all supporting `Material3` dynamic colors.
- **Minimum API is 24**

<br>

## üöÄ How to install and use
1. Add the JitPack repository to your `settings.gradle` file

```gradle
repositories {
    ...
    maven( url = "https://jitpack.io" )
}
```

2. Add the dependency in your `build.gradle` file

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation 'com.github.alessiocameroni:pixely-components:2.1.5'
}
```

<br>

## üìñ Documentation

<br>
